# TokenParser
You provide the program a file that has expressions on them and the token parser will determine which are variables, integers, operators.  Lexemmes that are unknown will be skipped over.  This was a programming project I did at the university.

Just open this program in your favorite python ide.  I provided two test files so you know what is going on.
